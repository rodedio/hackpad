a hachpad how i like it

This is my Scapatic for my hackpad. I've changed it three times, but this is what I finally came up with and went with. I'm going for a Matrix-style button layout. The socket will be connected to an OLED screen.

This is the circuit board. I still had to make a few minor adjustments to the schematic. I added an extra knob. The rotary encoder adjusts the volume on my computer and displays it through a menu on the OLED screen. Allis included a 3D model so I can make it look better in 3D.
